## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Content-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to create a forms with custom error messages, it was a challenge getting it to look like the design but I am glad to have finally gotten it done.  



### Continued development

I would like to learn more about forms in order to be a able to create some amazing ones. I will also like to hone my javascript skills.
